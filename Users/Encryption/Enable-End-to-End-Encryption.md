The passwords app offers strong end-to-end encryption which requires anyone trying to decrypt your passwords to know the encryption passphrase.

#### Before you start
- By default, the encryption setup will encrypt all existing passwords, folders and tags except those who are shared.
- All previous revisions but the current will be deleted.
- The encryption setup will also create a new password entry with your encryption passphrase.
  If you do not want this, switch the settings view to "Advanced" in the top right corner and uncheck the options in step 5 of the setup.
- The encryption setup will create the new entries before deleting any old ones.
  So even if something goes wrong, there should be no data loss.
