The icon will be full black if an expiration date is set.
By hovering over the icon, you can see the date.

#### Unshare a password
By clicking on the `ðŸ—‘`-icon, the password will be no longer shared with the user.

#### Updating shared passwords
Passwords are released by creating a copy of the password in the account of the user with whom the password was shared.
By doing so, the receiver of the shared password can access the passwords without having access to your password library.
This also means that if a shared password is updated or the permissions of the share are changed, these changes need to be synchronized.
Since this synchronisation is done by the server in the background, it may take some minutes.
To make this process transparent to you, you will see a loading icon around the avatar of the user if there are changes pending for or from this specific user.
