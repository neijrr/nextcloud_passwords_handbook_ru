If sharing is allowed for this password, you can share it to other users from this tab.
You can also see who shared the password with you and which permissions you have. 
(If the password was shared with you)

For more details about password sharing, read [Sharing Passwords](./Sharing-Passwords).


## Revisions
[![The revisions tab of a password](../_files/_previews/password-details-revisions.jpg)](../_files/password-details-revisions.png)
Every time something about a password is changed, a new revision is created.
Each revision stores the complete password data.
Revisions can be seen revisions as the history of your password.
Revisions are immutable and can not be changed or deleted.
To view the details of a revision, simply click on the revision.
To restore a revision, click on the `⟲`-icon on the right.

## Action Menu
The action menu can be found on the right side under the website preview or in the top right corner if no website preview is shown.
It provides access to common tasks like editing, moving, cloning or deleting the password.

##### QR Code
The QR-Code tab allows you to transfer commonly used properties like the password, username or website simply by scanning a qr-code.
It makes it easy for example if you are setting up a new mobile device and don't want to type your (hopefully) long and complex password all by yourself.

##### Print password
If the [`print option`](../Settings#show-print-option-expert-settings) is enabled, you can open the print dialog from the menu.
