The settings section can be found under `More > Settings`.
These settings allow you to define how the app itself and the official clients behave.

## Expert Settings
Expert settings can be enabled by checking the "Expert Settings" box in the top right corner.

## Security
### Password Rules
Password rules activate additional security checks for passwords.
If a password fails one of these checks, it will be marked as weak.

> :star: The security status is updated once a day or when the password is changed.
> This means that changes are not applied immediately and the status of entries with the same password can differ.

##### Mark duplicates
If this option is enabled, passwords will be marked as weak if they appear more than once in your database.

##### Maximum age in days
Set a maximum age for passwords after which they will be marked as weak.
Setting the value to `0` will disable the check.

#### Security Check Hash (Expert Settings)
This setting defines how much of the SHA-1 hash used to compare each password against a list of known compromised passwords should be stored.
If the server is compromised, an attacker could use the SHA-1 hash to find the plain text value of a compromised password.
Storing a partial hash can reduce this risk, but also means that passwords may be marked as compromised despite being secure.
Storing no hash will prevent the password security check and the duplicate check from working.

Changes in this setting will be applied to new passwords immediately.
If a shorter value is selected, the hashes of existing passwords will be updated with the next password security check.
If a longer value is selected, the existing hashes will *not* be updated and remain short.
Changing this setting will have no impact on the status of passwords which were already marked as compromised.
The default value for this setting is defined by the administrator


### Password Generator
These settings define how the built-in password generator creates passwords.
You may be able to temporarily overwrite these settings when creating a password.
Your system administrator can choose which service is used to generate passwords.
Based on the service the actual generated password may differ.

##### Password strength
A higher number will increase the length and complexity of the generated password.
Every password will have at least 12 characters minimum.

##### Include numbers
If activated, the password generator will add numbers to the created password.

##### Include special characters
If activated, the password generator will add special characters like `$, €, @` to the created password.


### Login & Session
**Note:** This section is available if you have End-to-end encryption enabled

##### Keep me logged in
This setting controls how the app will keep the current session open before the encryption password needs to be entered again.
The option "Always" will keep the session open as long as the tab is open, 
"when i'm active" keeps it open as long as there is any kind of action in the tab and 
"when i'm working" only keeps the session open when there are requests to the server.

##### End session after (Expert Settings)
Controls how long the server should keep a session after the last contact to the client.
If the "Keep me logged in" setting is not set to "Always", this setting also controls how long the app will keep you logged in.


### Encryption
##### Server encryption mode (Expert Settings)
Choose the default server side encryption mode.

##### Client encryption mode (Expert Settings)
Choose the default client side encryption mode.

##### End-to-end Encryption
Set up end-to-end encryption for your passwords or change the encryption password.

##### Log in with WebAuthn
If end-to-end encryption is enabled and your browser supports it, you can log in with WebAuthn.
This stores your encryption passphrase in the browser and automatically retrieves it when you log in.
Log in with WebAuthn needs to be enabled on any device where you want to use it.
The set up process only stores the given passphrase in the browser, it does not check if it is the right passphrase.
If the passphrase is invalid, you will see an error message when you log in and need to enter the passphrase manually.

**Note:** Browsers may store your passphrase unencrypted in plain text and synchronize it using third party servers such as from Google (Chrome) or Microsoft (Edge).


## User Interface
##### Initial section
Here you can choose which section will be shown when you open the passwords app.
By default, the `Folders` section will be shown, but you can also select your `All Passwords`, `Favorites`, `Tags` or `Recent` passwords as inital section.

##### Show hidden custom fields (Expert Settings)

##### Add copy options in menu
If this option is enabled, the `⋯`-menu will contain two menu entries to copy the password and the username.
By default, these menu entries are not visible since you can copy the password by clicking on the name and the username by clicking twice.
On mobile devices the menu entries will always be shown regardless of whether this option enabled.

##### Show tags in the list view
You can show the tags for a password in the list view.
If you click on a tag the tag section will be opened and you can see all passwords with the tag.

## Danger Zone
The options in this section might irreversibly delete data from your account.
Therefore, it is recommended that you use them with caution.

##### Recover hidden items
This action will recover hidden items sich as passwords, folders and tags that are not visible in the Passwords app at all unless directly accessed.
You can choose to recover four types of hidden items:
 - **Passwords which aren't in a hidden folder**: will recover passwords which are hidden but are stored in a folder that is not hidden.
    If you moved a hidden password out of a hidden folder and it can no longer be seen in the app, this option will make the password visible in the folder it was moved to.
 - **All hidden passwords**: will recover any password marked as hidden, regardless of the folder it is in.
 - **All hidden folders**: will recover any folder that is marked as hidden. When used with "*Passwords which aren't in a hidden folder*", all passwords will be recovered.
 - **All hidden tags**: will recover any tag marked as hidden.

##### Reset all settings
This action will reset all settings stored in the Passwords app.
This will not only reset the settings visible here, but may also include settings from other apps or browser extension using the Passwords API.
Deleted settings can not be restored.

##### Delete everything
This action will delete all passwords, folders, tags and settings in your account.
It will also delete your private encryption key. This means that your data can not be restored.
You should make a backup and confirm that the backup works before you use this option.

**Note:** This option does not reset access tokens used by third party clients.
You can delete these in your personal settings.
