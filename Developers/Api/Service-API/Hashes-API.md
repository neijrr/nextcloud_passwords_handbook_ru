The hashes API returns the SHA-1 hashes of passwords contained in public data breaches.
The data can be searched by providing a SHA-1 hash or at least the first five characters of the hash.

# Privacy
The Passwords app usually saves the full SHA-1 has of a password alongside the password to enable automatic checks for breached passwords.
Users can choose to disable this check or just store a partial hash to improve their privacy.
Therefore, this API supports a [k-anonymity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity) approach in which the client requests all hashes within a given range and then confirms locally if a hash is within the set returned by the server.

# Endpoints

## Breached Hashes GET Endpoint
Get hashes by the given range.

#### URL
| Path                              | Method |
|-----------------------------------|--------|
| `/api/1.0/service/hashes/{range}` | GET    |

#### Arguments
| Name  | Type   | Default | Required | Description                                                      |
|-------|--------|---------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| range | string | -       | yes      | 5-40 characters of a SHA-1 hash to check against in the database |

#### Restrictions
- Nextcloud Authentication **required**
- User rate limit of **10 requests per 10 seconds**

#### Response
The API will respond with a list of SHA-1 hashes matching the provided range.
If no hashes match the given range, the response will have a 404 status code.

| Status | MIME             | Type     | Description               |
|--------|------------------|----------|---------------------------|
| 200    | application/json | string[] | A list of breached hashes |
| 404    | application/json | string[] | An empty list             |
| 429    | text/html        | -        | Rate limit exceeded       |
| 400    | application/json | object   | Error message             |

#### Response Example
```json
[
    "ace7700a317f9e0a0b86cdd0032d0edb0eb9d5cf",
    "ace77015084506525d74d585deb02467a29658a7",
    "ace77016ed9aa8c62ebf66fc06eba40a9cac087c"
]
```

#### Errors
| Code     | Message       | Description                                                                                          |
|----------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 49f5c936 | Invalid range | The hash range provided to the hashes endpoint is not within the allowed range of 5 - 40 characters. |

#### Notes
- In case of a 404 status code, some servers may replace the response with an HTML page.
    For any 404 response, the client can always assume that no hashes match the range.
- Requested range may be logged in server logs as it is part of the URL.



## Breached Hashes POST Endpoint
Get hashes by the given range.
The upside of a POST request over a GET request is that the requested range will not be logged to server logs.

#### URL
| Path                      | Method |
|---------------------------|--------|
| `/api/1.0/service/hashes` | POST   |

#### Request
This endpoint accepts a JSON formatted request body with an object with the following properties.

| Property | Type   | Default | Required | Description                                                      |
|----------|--------|---------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| range    | string | -       | yes      | 5-40 characters of a SHA-1 hash to check against in the database |

#### Restrictions
- Nextcloud Authentication **required**
- User rate limit of **10 requests per 10 seconds**

#### Response
The API will respond with a list of SHA-1 hashes matching the provided range.
If no hashes match the given range, the response will have a 404 status code.

| Status | MIME             | Type     | Description               |
|--------|------------------|----------|---------------------------|
| 200    | application/json | string[] | A list of breached hashes |
| 404    | application/json | string[] | An empty list             |
| 429    | text/html        | -        | Rate limit exceeded       |
| 400    | application/json | object   | Error message             |

#### Response Example
```json
[
    "ace7700a317f9e0a0b86cdd0032d0edb0eb9d5cf",

#### Notes
- In case of a 404 status code, some servers may replace the response with an HTML page.
    For any 404 response, the client can always assume that no hashes match the range.

# API Notes
- This API uses the security check service as configured in the app settings.
    Some security check services have limited databases and therefore can't guarantee that a hash is secure if it's not included.
- Lists of breached passwords are updated constantly.
    It is therefore not recommended to cache the response of this API for more than a day.
